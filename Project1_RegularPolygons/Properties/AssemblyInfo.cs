[assembly: AssemblyDescription("This program calculates attributes of a user-defined regular polygon. User inputs number of sides (n) as a whole number between 3 and 1,000,000 and the length of the sides (s) as a number greater than 0 and less than 1,000,000.\r\n\r\nFrom these values the program calculates the polygon's interior angle, circumradius, apothem, perimeter, area, central angle, and number of distinct diagonals. It also calculates the area and circumference of the polygon's circumcircle and the error percentage for approximating these values by the area and perimeter of the polygon.\r\n\r\nUsers can also print the GUI using the Print button, and for polygons with 100 or fewer sides users may choose to graph a representation of the polygon based on number of sides.")]
